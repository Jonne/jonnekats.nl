description: "Most headless Content Management Systems don't have an integrated way to structure a site's navigation. Kentico Kontent has recently released Spotlight, which is designed to fill this gap. In this article we will look into Spotlight and what it can do for you. Followed by a technical in-depth example of how to integrate Spotlight with NextJS, which is a static site generator."
